This app is a Blackjack style card game between two Pokemon characters. 

Two players can battle with randomly generated Pokemon avatars and play a "hotseat" style game of blackjack. The winner then gets to evolve their Pokemon!  

The game utilizes [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/), and also employs the client's given design kit. 

The game is fully keyboard operable, designed to be responsive down to a screen size of 320px, and accessible.
